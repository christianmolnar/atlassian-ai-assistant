## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note About Installation

The VS Code extension requires configuration to work with your own
Atlassian instance, as Atlassian sites are private and you won't have
access to the demo environment. The Installation Guide provides complete
instructions for this setup.

## üí° Key Takeaway

This prototype demonstrates that **organized knowledge enables
exponentially better AI experiences**. The generated code isn't
impressive because the AI is smarter---it's impressive because it has
access to complete, structured context that Atlassian's platform
naturally provides.
