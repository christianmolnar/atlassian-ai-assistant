## üöÄ Quick Start for Atlassian Employees

This guide helps you install and test the AI-powered VS Code extension that integrates Jira, Confluence, and AI for intelligent code generation.

**Simple 3-step process**: Install extension ‚Üí Run command ‚Üí Follow setup prompts ‚Üí Start using!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Prerequisites Checklist

### ‚úÖ What You Need

- [ ] Windows, Mac, or Linux computer
- [ ] Access to Atlassian Cloud (Jira + Confluence)
- [ ] Admin access to create API tokens
- [ ] OpenAI API key (for AI code generation)
- [ ] **IMPORTANT**: At least one Jira project with **well-written** issues (detailed descriptions, clear requirements)
- [ ] **IMPORTANT**: At least one Confluence space with **substantial** documentation (coding standards, architecture docs, examples)
- [ ] 10 minutes for setup

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Critical for Success**: This extension's effectiveness depends entirely on the **quality and depth** of your Atlassian content:
> 
> **EXCELLENT Results When You Have:**
> - Jira stories with detailed descriptions, acceptance criteria, and technical requirements
> - Confluence pages with coding standards, architectural patterns, API documentation, or code examples
> - Well-organized, team-maintained documentation
>
> **POOR Results When You Have:**
> - Sparse Jira tickets with minimal descriptions ("Fix bug", "Add feature")  
> - Empty or outdated Confluence spaces
> - Little to no technical documentation
>
> **Bottom Line**: The AI can only be as good as your content. If your Atlassian instance lacks detailed stories and rich documentation, the generated code will be generic and unhelpful.
>
> üí° **Want to see what good content looks like?** Check the **"1. CASE STUDY.docx"** to see examples of well-written Jira stories and Confluence documentation that produce excellent AI-generated code.

- üõ†Ô∏è **Customization** - Modify or extend if desired (advanced users only)

**Just use the .vsix file for the full experience!**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Understanding the Extension Configuration

### Critical Setup Requirement

**The extension must be configured to work with YOUR Atlassian
instance.** Since Atlassian sites are private, you cannot access the
development environment where this was built. You'll need to set it up
for your own Jira and Confluence.

### What You Need

- Access to Atlassian Cloud (Jira + Confluence)
- Admin permissions to create API tokens
- At least one Jira project with some issues
- At least one Confluence space with some documentation

### If You Don't Have These

You can still install the extension to see the interface and commands,
but the API calls will fail when trying to connect to Jira/Confluence.
The extension will demonstrate the concept even without live data.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Step 5: Test the Extension

### Quick Test Sequence

1.  **Open Command Palette**: `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux) or
    `Cmd+Shift+P` (Mac)
2.  **Type**: "Atlassian"
3.  **You should see**:
    - üöÄ **Open Your Atlassian Project**
    - ü§ñ **Generate Code from Jira Story**

### Test 1: Try Any Command (This Triggers Setup)

1.  **Run**: Either "üöÄ Open Your Atlassian Project" or "ü§ñ Generate Code from Jira Story"
2.  **First time**: Extension will prompt for configuration (see Step 4)
3.  **Follow the prompts**: Enter your Atlassian and OpenAI details
4.  **Success**: Extension configured and ready to use!

### Test 2: Open Your Atlassian Project

1.  **Run**: "üöÄ Open Your Atlassian Project"
2.  **Choose**: "Open Jira Projects" or "Open Confluence Spaces"
3.  **Result**: Your browser opens to your actual Atlassian instance

### Test 3: Code Generation

1.  **Create**: New file in VS Code (`Ctrl+N`)
2.  **Run**: "ü§ñ Generate Code from Jira Story"
3.  **Enter**: A Jira issue key from YOUR project (e.g., "PROJ-1", "TASK-5", etc.)
4.  **Watch**: AI generates TypeScript code in your file
5.  **Result**: Professional code appears that combines your Jira story with any Confluence documentation patterns!

**Note**: Use issue keys from YOUR Jira project. The extension will fetch real data from your Atlassian instance.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Step 6: Understand What You're Seeing

### The Magic Moment

When you run "Generate Code from Jira Story" with your own issue:

1.  **Extension reads** your Jira story details (title, description,
    requirements)
2.  **Extension fetches** any relevant documentation from your
    Confluence
3.  **AI combines** both sources to generate contextually-aware code
4.  **Result**: Code that reflects your specific requirements AND any
    team patterns from your documentation

### Why This Matters

- **Better AI**: Context from organized knowledge beats generic AI
  responses
- **Team Consistency**: Generated code can follow established patterns
  if documented in Confluence
- **Developer Productivity**: Less context switching, more focused
  development
- **Competitive Advantage**: Shows why Atlassian's integrated platform
  enables superior AI experiences

### What You'll See

The generated code will vary based on your actual Jira stories and
Confluence content. The more structured information you have in your
Atlassian instance, the better the AI-generated results will be.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Troubleshooting

### Extension Not Appearing?

- **Check**: Extensions panel (`Ctrl+Shift+X`) for "Atlassian AI
  Assistant"
- **Try**: Developer: Reload Window (`Ctrl+Shift+P`)
- **Restart**: Close and reopen VS Code

### Commands Not Working?

- **Verify**: API tokens are correctly configured
- **Check**: Internet connection for API calls
- **Look**: At VS Code Developer Console for error messages

### API Errors?

- **Token expired**: Create new API token
- **Wrong site**: Verify your Atlassian site URL
- **Permissions**: Ensure token has Jira and Confluence read access

### Generated Code is Generic/Poor Quality?

**This is the most common issue!** The extension is working correctly, but your Atlassian content isn't rich enough:

- **Check your Jira story**: Does it have detailed descriptions, acceptance criteria, technical requirements?
- **Check your Confluence**: Do you have coding standards, examples, architectural docs the AI can reference?
- **Compare to Case Study**: Look at "1. CASE STUDY.docx" for examples of the content quality needed
- **Remember**: Generic input = generic output. The AI needs good source material to generate good code.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Next Steps

### For Your Own Project

1.  **Set up**: Your own Jira project with real stories
2.  **Create**: Confluence pages with your team's coding standards
3.  **Configure**: Extension to use your Atlassian instance
4.  **Generate**: AI code that follows YOUR team patterns

### Strategic Discussion Points

- How does this change developer productivity?
- What's the competitive advantage vs.¬†scattered documentation?
- How could this scale across your entire development organization?
- What other AI integrations become possible with organized knowledge?
