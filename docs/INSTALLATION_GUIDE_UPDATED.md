------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Step 4: Configure the Extension

### Update Extension Settings

1.  **Open the extension source code** (if you want to use your own
    Atlassian instance)
2.  **Navigate to**: `src/extension.ts`
3.  **Find this section** (around line 6):

<!-- -->

    const ATLASSIAN_CONFIG = {
        email: 'your-email@company.com',           // ‚Üê Your Atlassian email
        token: 'your-api-token-here',              // ‚Üê Token from Step 3
        site: 'yourcompany.atlassian.net'          // ‚Üê Your Atlassian site
    };

4.  **Replace** with your actual values
5.  **Save** the file
6.  **Recompile**: Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` ‚Üí Type "Developer: Reload
    Window"

## Step 4: Configure the Extension for Your Atlassian Instance

### Required: Update Extension Configuration

Since the extension is currently configured for a private development
environment, you must update it to work with your Atlassian instance.

### Method 1: Edit the Installed Extension Files

1.  **Find Extension Installation Directory**:
    - **Windows**: `%USERPROFILE%\.vscode\extensions\`
    - **Mac**: `~/.vscode/extensions/`
    - Look for folder starting with `atlassian-ai-assistant`
2.  **Edit Configuration File**:
    - Open `out/extension.js` in the extension folder
    - Find the `ATLASSIAN_CONFIG` section (near the top)
    - Replace the placeholder values with yours:

- const ATLASSIAN_CONFIG = {
          email: 'your-email@company.com',        // Your Atlassian email
          token: 'your-api-token-from-step-3',    // API token from Step 3
          site: 'yourcompany.atlassian.net'       // Your Atlassian site
      };

  - **Save** the file
  - **Restart VS Code**

### Method 2: Modify and Rebuild (If Source Code Provided)

1.  **Edit Source**: Update `src/extension.ts` with your configuration
2.  **Compile**: Run `npm run compile` in the extension directory
3.  **Package**: Run `vsce package` to create new .vsix file
4.  **Reinstall**: Install the updated .vsix file

### Your Atlassian Site Information

- **Email**: The email you use to log into Atlassian
- **Token**: Created in Step 3 above
- **Site**: Found in your Atlassian URL (e.g., if your Jira is at
  `https://mycompany.atlassian.net`, then your site is
  `mycompany.atlassian.net`)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Understanding the Extension Configuration

### Critical Setup Requirement

**The extension must be configured to work with YOUR Atlassian
instance.** Since Atlassian sites are private, you cannot access the
development environment where this was built. You'll need to set it up
for your own Jira and Confluence.

### What You Need

- Access to Atlassian Cloud (Jira + Confluence)
- Admin permissions to create API tokens
- At least one Jira project with some issues
- At least one Confluence space with some documentation

### If You Don't Have These

You can still install the extension to see the interface and commands,
but the API calls will fail when trying to connect to Jira/Confluence.
The extension will demonstrate the concept even without live data.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Step 5: Test the Extension

### Quick Test Sequence

1.  **Open Command Palette**: `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux) or
    `Cmd+Shift+P` (Mac)
2.  **Type**: "Atlassian"
3.  **You should see**:
    - üöÄ **Show Demo Info**
    - ü§ñ **Generate Code from Jira Story**

### Test 1: Demo Info

1.  **Run**: "üöÄ Show Demo Info"
2.  **Expected**: Popup with links to Jira and Confluence
3.  **Click**: The links to see the demo project

### Test 2: Code Generation

1.  **Create**: New file in VS Code (`Ctrl+N`)
2.  **Run**: "ü§ñ Generate Code from Jira Story"
3.  **Enter**: A Jira issue key from YOUR project (e.g., "PROJ-1",
    "TASK-5", etc.)
4.  **Watch**: AI generates TypeScript code in your file
5.  **Result**: Professional code appears that combines your Jira story
    with any Confluence documentation patterns!

**Note**: Use issue keys from YOUR Jira project, not "SCRUM-1" which was
from the development environment.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Step 6: Understand What You're Seeing

### The Magic Moment

When you run "Generate Code from Jira Story" with your own issue:

1.  **Extension reads** your Jira story details (title, description,
    requirements)
2.  **Extension fetches** any relevant documentation from your
    Confluence
3.  **AI combines** both sources to generate contextually-aware code
4.  **Result**: Code that reflects your specific requirements AND any
    team patterns from your documentation

### Why This Matters

- **Better AI**: Context from organized knowledge beats generic AI
  responses
- **Team Consistency**: Generated code can follow established patterns
  if documented in Confluence
- **Developer Productivity**: Less context switching, more focused
  development
- **Competitive Advantage**: Shows why Atlassian's integrated platform
  enables superior AI experiences

### What You'll See

The generated code will vary based on your actual Jira stories and
Confluence content. The more structured information you have in your
Atlassian instance, the better the AI-generated results will be.

## Understanding What You're Seeing

### The Magic Moment

When you run "Generate Code from Jira Story":
